- q: What should be the break between SMK and Bhuta Shuddhi?
  a: |
      We received only such information: Bhuta Shuddhi, then Shambhavi.
      Also Bhuta Shuddhi to be done before sunrise or after sunset. That's all.
      If you have done Shambhavi in the evening, then eat, wait for an empty 
      stomach and you can do Bhuta Shuddhi.

- q: Is it possible to do Bhuta Shuddhi after sunrise?
  a: |
      It is possible, but the effect will be less. You can do it after 
      sunset, before going to bed.

- q: In which hand do we pour water into Bhuta Shuddhi?
  a: In Bhuta Shuddhi we pour water in the right hand.

- q: In Bhuta Shuddhi in fire and in air, do we start by inhaling or exhaling?
  a: Everything is like in life, we start with an inhalation, we end with an exhalation.
