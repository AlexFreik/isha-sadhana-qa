- q: Is it possible to practice Hatha Yoga under the rain?
  a: No, we do not practice under the rain, although we have not received strict restrictions.

- q: Can I do yoga if I eat non-veg and drink?
  a: |
      Yoga isn't a restriction, it's a deeper understanding of life.
      If you knew how to become absolutely ecstatic just by your own chemistry, 
      you wouldn't smoke or take a drink in your life. I've never touched a 
      substance but if you look at my eyes, I'm always stoned. Yogis look at
      alcohol, drugs and these things as kindergarten stuff because we can 
      get intoxicated a thousand times over just with our aliveness. Why 
      simply wine? You can get drunk with the di-vine!

- q: How can yoga help in overall development?
  a: |
      Yoga is not about self-development; it is about self-dissolution. 
      It is the method or the process which allows an individual piece of 
      life to yoke itself to the cosmic. When your experience of life shifts 
      from being a limited entity to universality, this is yoga. When there is a
      kind of oneness or wholeness within ourselves, this is yoga. Then you have 
      a certain freedom to play with your life whichever way you want, but at the 
      same time life cannot leave a scratch upon you.

- q: Does yoga require the help of an instructor or can it be self-taught?
  a: |
      Let us say you are seeking to go to a distant city. If you are alone and
      there are no proper directions, definitely you would wish for a map. It
      is not that you cannot do it yourself, but we do not know how long it will
      take. On an uncharted path, if you go without a map, you may take lifetimes 
      to get there. If you go with a map, you will cross easily. If you go with a
      good bus driver, you will cross very easily; that is the difference. When 
      you want to walk uncharted terrain, it is intelligent to choose a person who 
      has already walked the terrain.
